            <p class=MsoNormal>The current curator of
  the Colonial Museum of Marseille collection finds himself frequently
  garbage-picking. At its prime in the first decades of the 20th century, the
  museum, operated by the Colonial Institute of Marseille, became the unnatural
  home to thousands of accumulated materials, mostly plants, from Africa, the
  Caribbean, Asia and South America. Drawing huge crowds and attracting the
  attention of industrialists to the museum and Marseille’s Colonial Expositions
  in 1906 and 1922, these objects became material symbols of French control of
  lands, territories, and people. The joint forces of colonialism, nationalist
  propaganda, and scientific capitalism would designate Marseille’s ports as a
  semi-permeable boundary between France and its declared possessions, resulting
  in an ever-growing accumulation of looted rocks, skulls, tools, birds, mammals,
  reptiles, and shells brought back in suitcases for scientific analysis. When
  the first World War commanded a global captive audience, however, the Colonial
  Museum of Marseille and its research institution fell into disrepair. A revival
  before the Second World War was short-lived and futile. The institute would
  soon fade into shameful obscurity during liberation and decolonization
  movements of the 1960s through the 1980s. Natural history and ethnographic
  museums, full of stolen objects and artifacts from former colonies and overseas
  “departments,” became sites of politicized epistemic debates.</p>


            <p class=MsoNormal>Rather than respond to
  the demand to categorically interrogate French imperialism, and with the
  scarcity of post-war funding, many scientific-colonial research institutions
  and museums closed. The National Museum of Natural History closed its doors due
  to safety hazards in 1965 and the roof of a museum in Toulouse caved in before
  the end of the 20th century. But the 1990s saw a revival of many of France’s
  colonial museums, undergoing identity shifts to demonstrate, or strategically
  appear to, recognize their foundational colonial ideologies, marked by the
  re-opening, rebranding, and re-appropriating of objects between the Museum of
  Natural History and the Museum of Man in Paris. Most infamously, however, was
  the 2005 opening of Quai Branl<span lang=EN style='12.0pt;
  line-height:115%;'>y—an<span
  > ethnographic museum dreamed up by former French
  President Chiraq—<span >which amassed hundreds
  of thousands objects from the natural history and anthropology museums to form
  a “new” museum which, in truth, resonates more with the classical systematics
  of colonial collections than the revamped historic institutions. Through this
  political and aesthetic shuffle, many smaller collections and museums struggled
  to redefine themselves or assert new missions, falling out of national and
  regional focus, and others avoided formulating a post-colonial museum ethics
  completely. 
            </p>


            <p class=MsoNormal>In Marseille, like many
  other cities beyond the Paris bubble, the historic collections have been
  periodically picked through by niche researchers, colonialists with
  commemorative nostalgia, and amateurs impassioned by the exotic, but mostly,
  they have been fated to decades of mistreatment in damp storage closets. With
  irreparable damages and disorder, an untrained eye might dispose of a crumbling
  specimen, believing it to be trash that affixed itself to the autumn leaves
  that blew in with the <i>mistral</i>, the uncomfortably cold Marseille wind. 
  Of course, there are also those who round up these objects for dumpsters on
  purpose. Some are fueled by embarrassment, subscribing to a genre of magical
  thinking that believes purging evidence of injury settles past ordeals. Many
  others do not see the value of holding onto this history, especially without
  funding to keep it well preserved. In direct struggle for the limited space of
  the overcrowded classrooms and laboratories of Marseille’s local science
  university, the remains of France’s first colonial institution have been
  squeezed into a few small rooms. In one room, leaflets folded and stuffed with
  dried leaves, twigs, flowers and seeds fill floor to ceiling lockers. Spillover
  from uncatalogued herbarium specimens and antique museum display cases from the
  19th century are organized by territory and potential industrial application.
  In both cases, objects are fated to real-life tetris: a crisis of constant
  rearrangement, in a crowded cemetery of colonial nostalgia.</p>


            <p class=MsoNormal>The threat of time on
  recent memory and museum preservation is omnipresent. Presently, the once
  celebrated, then hidden, now deteriorated objects of the Colonial Museum of
  Marseille are being recovered and inventoried by over-committed staff and
  volunteer retirees in an attempt to symbolically recover this “lost” heritage:
  “lost” implying the paternalistic possession of objects that were never meant
  to be so far from home.</p>



            The science fiction of colonial epistemic
  culture / Colonial Projections / Long Distance, Exclusive Relationship</b></p>



            <p class=MsoNormal>The founder of the
  Colonial Museum of Marseille, Doctor Edouard Marie Heckel, never set foot in
  Madagascar, but considered himself an expert anyway.</p>


            <p class=MsoNormal>While he may have never
  proclaimed himself as such, his actions speak volumes, and those who honored
  him throughout his career vehemently agreed. During the antecedent to a medical
  school-resume-padding-gap-year, Heckel left France and headed to the Antilles.
  Not unsurprisingly, as often happens, the group of colonizers fell ill. Unable
  to take a hint, they persisted, often in desperate conditions fueled by greed,
  fear of losing nationalist clout and facing the failure of their paternalism.
  Somehow surviving an epidemic of yellow fever, Heckel outlived his colonial
  buddies, claiming to have used local botanical samples which subsequently
  oriented his scientific interests towards the possibility of colonizers using
  local plants to heal themselves abroad.</p>



            <p class=MsoNormal>At 22, barely out of
  adolescence, Heckel was appointed chief of colonial naval pharmacy in New
  Caledonia and he would later go on to be awarded a medical degree and doctorate
  in natural sciences in France, between trips to places such as India, Java,
  Senegal, and Australia. Starting around 1875, Heckel began his eventual
  retirement project of methodically mining, organizing and appropriating medical
  knowledge from French colonies, slowing circling in on his opportune interest
  in Madagascar, France’s prized acquisition of 1894/5. Because France’s
  1895 invasion of Madagascar is considered one of the worst medical failures in
  the history of European colonization due to the calamity of disease-caused
  deaths, Heckel was able to highlight his patriotic benevolence in the field of
  research in tropical medicine.</p>



            <p class=MsoNormal>In 1893, just one year
  before the French invaded Madagascar with intention to colonize by any means
  possible, Heckel politicked enough funds to found France’s very first colonial
  institute for scientific research: the Colonial Institute of Marseille. Enticed
  by the possibility of the ‘unknown’ of Madagascar’s highly specified and unique
  endemic flora, Heckel recognized potential to profiteer by filling the space of
  not-knowing with his own scientific-colonial mythologies. Under the veneer of
  improving the colonies through scientific development or “<i>mise en valeur</i>”,
  Heckel sold the exotic dream of Madagascar’s pharmacopeia for personal and
  national exploitation to local merchants and politicians in Marseille.</p>

            <p class=MsoNormal> </p>

            <p class=MsoNormal>Intimately examining plants <span
  >under a microscope, Heckel sat in his armchair in the
  soap industry capital of France, some 8,000km away<span > from the country’s novel colonial possession of his
  interest. He claimed to determine the usefulness and validity of these plant
  materials to cure colonizers, despite never having had any personal contact with Malagasy healing practices. So it should come as no surprise that Heckel never recognized the plants as functional lines of communication
                with Malagasy ancestors, portals only permeable to  an attuned beholder.  
            </p>

            <p class=MsoNormal>By using the technology
  of the encyclopedia – the 19th century natural history database system – Heckel
  published authoritative texts on Malagasy “medicinal and toxic” plants.
  Pieces of Malagasy plant knowledge were written on scraps of newsprint wrapped
  in dried leaves, providing clues that Heckel would use in his determination of
  usefulness.<span > It was through his network of
                <span >colonial administrators, merchants and botanists that he was able to  extract information from Malagasy people, situating himself as an aggregator and filter of what knowledge
                was “true” or “useful.” Meanwhile, the Malagasy people who were both interrogated for, and shared, this knowledge would remain uncited, nameless, and invisible contributors in Heckel’s scientific papers. (That is,
                except for one man, Gershon Ramisiray, who was one of the first French-accredited Malagasy doctors and therefore recognized as meritting citation, despite Heckel’s colleague and prominent natural historian Grandidier
                omitting Ramisiray’s “Dr” prefix in print.) <span >The outcome of this pervasive and strategic politics
  of non-recognition is such that Heckel continues to be widely cited to this day
  and celebrated for his massive undertaking to amass, re-name, and record
  “useful” plants from France’s colonial. But Heckel is no hero. Nor did he
  invent Madagascar’s pharmacopeia. The salvation narrative of scientific progress has traditionally glorified the encyclopedic aims of colonial botany, slipping into the hagiographic genre of scientific forefathers.
            </p>

            <p class=MsoNormal> </p>

            <p class=MsoNormal>How can you learn an epistemology of
  something as intimate as healing from a distance? Concerned with cataloging
  cures and remedies, publishing verbose encyclopedias, and obsessively authoring
  himself into historical significance, Doctor Heckel did not realize the limits
  of becoming expert in something he knew nothing about. He indexed this
  information without regard for sovereignty of the knowledge already existing in
  a structured form of its own<span > superimposing his
  own terms and categories. In re-authoring knowledge and dismissing local
  epistemologies,, Heckel overlooked the true potency of Madagascar’s pharmacopeia.
                <span > 
            </p>




            <p class=MsoNormal>Any encyclopedia created by a French
  scientist with no knowledge of Malagasy ancestors is conveniently mistranslated
  and misinterpreted,  a reenvisioning of Malagasy medicine as a fetishized cure
  for France’s futile colonial economy, as something it is not – something weak,
  something containable in materials alone.</p>

            Epistemologies of Healing in Madagascar
  Today / Sizeable Incongruencies</b></p>

             </b></p>

            <p class=MsoNormal>Tucked away on a dirt-road passage a few
  blocks from the central open-air market, vendors of Malagasy medicine, or <i>pharmacie
  gasy, </i>as it’s called, go about their daily affairs of sorting dried plants,
  arranging bottles of oils and diagnosing clients. Maudeline laughs and gossips
  through closed teeth as she flosses using the stem end of a leafy twig, a
  confident gesture that, according to her son, lures in potential business.
  Whether or not this is the source of her success, I do not know. But I do know
  that on any given day, Maudeline, also known as Mody, is one of the most
  successful vendors in the city.</p>

            <p class=MsoNormal> </p>

            <p class=MsoNormal>Mody is first and foremost a salesperson -
  her time spent gathering bundles of plants into marketable sheafs measured by
  wrapping two-hands around the girth and stringing <i>ody</i> beads onto fishing
  line to hang from the wooden beams. In Madagascar’s ancestral practices, healing
  includes the medico-botanical. But more significantly, healing spans beyond a
  Cartesian segmentation of time and space;;'>—the
  motions of material and social exchange of Malagasy medicine begin, and end,
  long before and long after the point of sale.</p>

            <p class=MsoNormal> </p>

            <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN style='12.0pt;line-height:115%;
  ;;'>Fiscal,
  familial, and bodily concerns<span lang=EN style='12.0pt;
  line-height:115%;'> are all of equal gravity<span lang=EN style=''> and
  can always be traced to a spiritual cause. As a pharmacist of ‘traditional’
  medicine, Mody is a broker of protections. She keeps the ancestors pleased and
  the work of evil spirits at bay. The daughter of a migrant from the southern
  regions of Madagascar (well known for healers and diviners) and growing up
  around a <i>pharmacie gasy</i> stall herself, Mody has built a loyal clientele
  over 30 years through word of mouth and reputation for her competence in both
  inherited and acquired knowledge.</p>

            <p class=MsoNormal> </p>

            <p class=MsoNormal>Holding the foundational beliefs of
  Malagasy traditions and taboos, she is simultaneously an avid church-goer,
  placing her in the profitable position of appealing to clients through the
  joint logics of Malagasy beliefs and Catholicism. Anything she cannot diagnose
  herself, she refers to those who can call directly upon ancestors, such as
  healer-priests<i>, </i><span >witches, and some midwives, who consult the wise spirits often for a fee (a sacrifice of livestock, an offer of cigarettes,or present of libations, depending on the
                situation and spirits being indulged). Each of these providers work individually with clients depending on their spiritual and physical needs, ranging from misfortune to spirit possession to cancer – illnesses which
                are all not necessarily unrelated in a cosmology that often locates the root causes of ailments in ancestral discontents.
            </p>

            <p class=MsoNormal> </p>

            <p class=MsoNormal>Malagasy medicine is incredibly
  site-specific in its origins, applications, and emergent strategies. Many
  elders go so far as to contend that <i>pharmacie gasy</i>, does not work away from
  the sea-bordered red island simply because the ancestors are not there. In
  addition to the highly unique flora of the island--much of which exists only in
  Madagascar--and the perimeter of <i>pharmacie gasy</i> influence, people must
  physically go to Madagascar to heal themselves. And many do. Clients from
  surrounding islands and even neighboring continental habitants come to
  Madagascar seeking the cures of <i>pharmacie gasy</i>, usually as a last resort
  for ailments that defy biomedicine’s bisections of the social/physical and
  material/spiritual logics. It is in this space of Malagasy homeland – the <i>tanindrazina</i>
  – that the island’s highly endemic and specialized plants and epistemologies of
  healing work for those who believe its power. As long as the materials remain in
  Madagascar, they can easily reach the ancestors. The <i>pharmacie gasy</i>
  epistemology of healing is in the intentionality of the plant usage, its
  connection to the land, the ancestors, the healer and of course, the specific
  needs of the patient. In this worldsense, the material is a portal, not a pill.</p>

            <p class=MsoNormal> </p>

            <p class=MsoNormal>Vendors like Mody have a consistent
  location, fixed in position that holds the materials of a system of knowledge
  static for a moment that is already otherwise in perpetual motion, only visible
  during moments of impact, like evidence of the atomic structure captured by the
  Rutherford gold foil experiment. Heckel and his colleagues only saw the
  evidence directly before their eyes, missing the real magnitude of <i>pharmacie
  gasy</i> beyond the scale of their microscopes.</p>

            <p class=MsoNormal> </p>

            Exporting Medical Epistemes / Economic and
  Cosmological Friction</b></p>

             </b></p>

            <p class=MsoNormal>Maudeline is aware of the centuries-long
  history of forced migration of plant materials across borders. She attributes
  it to a global need for <i>pharmacie gasy</i> and to the lucrative quality of
  medicinal plants, or what pharmaceutical interests have deemed green gold. “We
  offer a health service, but this is also a business for us,” Mody described her
  work, “and some people are profiting more than others.” On the other hand, Mody
  conceded, even if people are unaware of the root causes, “There are people
  worldwide who need <i>p</i>​<i>harmacie gasy</i>,​ especially if they are
  possessed by evil spirits.” Even in defense of the global need for <i>pharmacie
  gasy</i>, the skewed relationship between Mody’s economic precarity and vital
  expertise pose the relevant questions: At what cost? With what understanding?
  And at whose expense?</p>

            <p class=MsoNormal> </p>

            <p class=MsoNormal>The 500 Ariary ($0.15) it costs to buy a
  plant from Mody is not the going rate in Global North economies. The same
  materials can be found in luxury age-defying cosmetic products at a price point
  five-hundred times that amount and containing mere drops from the extracted
  plant. With France remaining the final destination of more than half of the
  essential oils derived from Madagascar’s plants, the diaspora of plants for
  profit across national borders reveals the ways that, once removed from
  context, healing epistemologies become lucrative along centuries of
  well-grooved economic routes of colonial power.</p>

            <p class=MsoNormal> </p>

            <p class=MsoNormal>Completely void of any Malagasy understanding
  of what is being healed, the causes, and the suitable metrics of success,
  pharmaceutical, natural health and cosmetic brands fashion <i>pharmacie gasy </i>materials
  into culturally inappropriate, fetishized tools for profit. Aided by the fact
  that Madagascar is deemed a “biodiversity hotspot” in which most of the flora
  and fauna is endemic, Madagascar is depicted as a Garden of Eden which belongs
  to all humankind, thus avoiding the neocolonial truth of the treatment of the
  Malagasy people and their epistemologies of healing in a localized context.</p>

            <p class=MsoNormal> </p>

            <p class=MsoNormal>With <i>pharmacie gasy</i>, it is about
  plants, but also about diagnosis. The diagnosis can be identified once the
  cause is pinpointed, embedding the entire process in social relationships with
  the spirits of royal ancestors, nature, and lost souls, including the dynamics
  of faith entrusted in the tradi-­practitioners themselves. Depending on the
  belief system of the patient, different protections and risks of exploitation
  throughout the healing process are present. In the marketplace of <i>pharmacie
  gasy</i>, patients have options regarding the approach they wish to take
  depending on their situation, beliefs and finances. The origin of an illness
  itself also dictates how one might seek out proper care; for example, when
  afflicted by certain metaphysical illnesses, one cannot go to a biomedical
  doctor to be treated because they are not experts in addressing malevolent
  spirits.</p>

            <p class=MsoNormal> </p>

            <p class=MsoNormal>If <i>pharmacie gasy</i> prioritizes
  determining individualized social and (often invisible) spiritual causes to
  imbue  phytomedicine with healing intention, biomedicine defines medical care
  as visual diagnostics based on a generalizable patient and the repeated use of
  pills. Biomedical treatment is a set of discrete, standardized practices
  grounded in material cures that possess physical matter with the potential to
  heal. This emphasis on materiality in biomedicine attempts to sterilize
  networks of social and spiritual relationships that are central to <i>pharmacie
  gasy</i>​. This epistemology of healing explains biomedicine’s obsession with
  isolating the specific “active” elements of the plant, which then undergo
  enhancement through privatized European technology. The concretization of the
  material and monetary occludes the connections between the material and
  immaterial world, an undeniable aspect of all ecosystems of healing in all of
  its personal, symbolic, material, political, transnational, intergenerational,
  and economic complexity.</p>

            <p class=MsoNormal> </p>

            <p class=MsoNormal>Epistemic violence of  the isolating and
  mono-narratives of healing uphold the delusion that it is possible to heal in a
  vacuum. How does anyone experience healing if not in relation?</p>

            <p class=MsoNormal> </p>

            <span lang=EN>[Conspiring bodies, bullets and water, one
  shot cure all, medicine and mirage]</b></p>

            <span lang=EN>&nbsp;</b></p>

            <p class=MsoNormal>There are too many centuries of
  testimonies and evidence to dismiss the power, relevance and ubiquity of <i>pharmacie
  gasy</i>. No data or statistics exist to demonstrate how pervasive the practice
  of <i>pharmacie gasy</i> is in Madagascar precisely because it is undeniably
  omnipresent. Figures of speech, logics of local government, pregnancy and birth
  practices are all bound to the presiding ancestral cosmology. Regardless of
  political and religious  beliefs, the ancestral realm reigns in Madagascar,
  especially when it comes to health. Healing can both take place at church with
  an ancestral ceremony and at a biomedical clinic depending on a number of
  factors: the root of the illness, a client’s financial situation, and the
  interactions between multiple overlapping belief systems. Even those in
  Madagascar who choose not to practice <i>pharmacie gasy</i> are believers in
  their own right, and skepticism is often a form of reverence and trepidation.
  Not practicing does not indicate disbelief or doubt, but quite the opposite:
  calling the ancestors into play is power, at times with considerable
  consequences that can touch any aspect of life.</p>

            <p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

            <p class=MsoNormal>All use of “charms and talismans” of
  “traditional medicine” was banned in Madagascar from 1904 to 1947 under
  France’s Code de l'Indigénat in attempt to control the Malagasy population and
  criminalize healers. The forced assimilation policies made it so that Malagasy
  people were mandated to comply with biomedicinal standards imposed by the
  Western world – a masked humanitarianism initiated by the French
  governor-general of Madagascar at the time, Joseph Simon Gallieni. Gallieni
  used biomedical rationale to conduit Madagascar’s growing population into an
  exploitable labor force used to build colonial infrastructure. Acting as a
  riptide, colonial legislation and medical imperialism evacuated Madagascar of
  its healers, occupying the vacuum with authoritative stances on corporeal
  autonomy; the calculated undercurrents pulled Malagasy medicine into French
  laboratories for closer examination and forced Malagasy healers to retreat
  further into secrecy. (Even after “independence” from France in 1960,
  Madagascar’s political and ethnic elite instated health policies closely
  aligned with those installed by the French, requiring all practitioners to have
  formal, standardized university knowledge in order to practice, confining
  healers and practitioners into a tight space of illegality.)</p>

            <p class=MsoNormal> </p>

            <p class=MsoNormal>But “out of sight, out of mind” often
  proves illusory. <i>Pharmacie gasy</i>, much like witchcraft and occult
  practices, can obfuscate political control by drawing upon sources which cannot
  always be named or reside in a concealed presence. Despite the legal
  enforcement of epistemic violence and exploitation, Malagasy healers persisted
  under French colonialism, continuing to either apprentice with elders or answer
  to convocations from spirit guides. Pushes for Malagasy national independence
  from colonial strongholds have always been grounded in tenants of access to
  ancestors and land, the same two central aspects of <i>pharmacie gasy</i>. The
  strength of the Malagasy people defending their land throughout history is
  insurmountable. </p>

            <p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

            <p class=MsoNormal>Historical accounts confirm their
  successfully pushing away multiple waves of potential colonizers, including the
  Portuguese, English, as well as many shipwrecked pirates and wanderers who
  mistook Madagascar as their own. In 1895, just two months after the
  pronouncement of formal French colonization, the Menalamba (or “red shawl”)
  revolt was led by a cult of hidden ancestors. Revolutionaries in this anti-colonial
  and anti-foreign influence rebellion wore fabric sanctified with smears of <span
  style='color:#141414'>red laterite soil from the island’s highlands. Despite France’s response to replace the island's civil governor with General Joseph Gallieni, exiling Malagasy Queen Ranavalona III
  to Reunion Island in the process, the movement successfully destroyed many European churches and inspired a resistance throughout the island.

  line-height:115%;'>Twenty years later,
  Malagasy French-trained doctors <span style='color:#212121;'>Joseph
  Raseta and Joseph Ravohangy, in a secret society at medical school, <span style='color:#212121;'>mobilised students to build a nationalist movement against French colonial rule (the Association
                des  étudiants d’origine malgache, AEOM.) AEOM gained traction in response to the 1921 plague outbreak, eventually forming a political party in 1944 called the Mouvement  démocratique  de  la  rénovation  malgache,
                or MDRM, which claimed sovereignty for the Malagasy people.
                
            </p>

            <p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

            <p class=MsoNormal>France rejected the MDRM’s formalized
  attempts at legal liberation. The insurrection against colonial rule that
  followed began in Moramanga and Manakara as a few Malagasy ambushes of French
  military bases and plantation, and soon spread throughout the south and central
  highlands. The French tripled down on military presence and the subsequent
  events of 1947 has been delicately documented by Malagasy author and poet
  Jean-Luc Raharimanana, who collected testimonies from the few elders who
  survived. In an atrocity against humanity, an incalculable number of Malagasy
  people-- most of whom were unarmed--were massacred by French troops by a
  profusion of terror tactics in response to demands for freedom. In
  Raharimanana’s interviews, survivors recount the rifle charm that saved their
  lives, “<i>rano, rano</i>” (water, water) – an ancestral technology which
  transmuted bullets shot by French colonial forces into droplets of water upon
  contact. Protecting the body as the bullets passed through like a river
  required a revolutionary shift in reality, one which traded the manufactured
  reality of colonizers for a more liberatory future. Echos of this revolutionary
  call sent waves throughout the Francophone world, its reverberations undoing
  this particular iteration of colonialism. </p>

             </b></p>

            <p class=MsoNormal>While the initial French interest in
  Malagasy botanical knowledge was economic, as much of it still is today, it is
  wrapped up in an unresolved ethics of colonial exploitation and epistemic
  justice. Today, museums catalogue and re-catalogue items according to public
  debates over the history of the “metropole”; they continue to re-shuffle
  objects a, and reproduce violence through taxonomy, avoiding the deeper
  epistemic work of reexamining questions of ownership, categories, names,
  locations, and material histories. Meanwhile, vendors throughout Madagascar,
  like Mody and her family, continue to develop botanical solutions acknowledging
  the presence of ancestors in all generative possibilities of  past, present,
  and future. </p>

  ;'>[Footnote]
  Non-anonymization in ethnography:</b></p>

            <p class=MsoNormal>The fields of
  anthropology and sociology are rooted in colonialism and eugenics. In
  contemporary discourse, despite having ethics boards and review processes, they
  maintain an  unresolved presence, to say the least, and especially so with communities
  that have historically been subjected to research. These disciplines require an
  overhaul, one which may require that they do not survive the process, and
  definitely warrant a revision of methods and methodologies. </p>

            <p class=MsoNormal>In ethnography, the
  standards of anonymization has been of recent debate. Other than the reality
  that anonymity is often impossible in the data collection process,
  anonymization also poses a fair share of troubling ethical concerns. Operating
  on a paternalistic model of protection and privacy, it has reproduced dynamics
  of epistemic violence in which information is extracted and presented as if the
  information does not have a traceable source, preventing fact-checking in many
  situations. </p>


            <p class=MsoNormal>For the purposes of my
  own research, I believe it is important to not just identify and critique
  hagiographic figures in science history but to also name knowledge producers
  whose contributions have been violently and systematically silenced. With the
  consent from informants, interlocutors, collaborators, and friends, after
  discussion of associated risks and confidentiality, I use real, identifiable
  names when I can. </p>
